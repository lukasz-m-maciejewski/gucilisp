#+TITLE: GuciLisp

* Feature roadmap
** language
*** add strings and character literals
*** add dot operator for building cons cells
Lists are not currently represented internally by cons cells. How do we represent cons cells;
a new special type or a two element list? Adding separate type for cons cells would result in
a need for quite a lot of conversions.
*** type annotations - colon syntax??
*** quoting and unqoting
*** user-defined functions
*** lisp macros - learn about them first

** internal utils
*** string_view version with tracking of original position

** code organization
*** pull eval to a module
*** ?? move to bazel ??
CMake is shitty AF


** user interaction
*** check whether running in tty or not, do something else based on that
